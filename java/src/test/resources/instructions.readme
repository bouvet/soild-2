Your task is to refactor the original CSVReader to better apply the open-closed principle:

"You should be able to extend a classes behavior, without modifying it."

Obviously, at this stage, refactoring a class requires you to change its implementation. The idea is that
refactoring the class should not break existing use cases. For this reason, a CsvReaderTest is added
which should not be altered and must not fail after refactoring is applied.

Furthermore, with every additional task, the tests of the previous tasks must remain in tact.

As a last assignment (number 5), it is required to implement a visitor pattern. This last task is not
connected to the previous tasks.
